## A Junior Front-End Developer Entry Basic Portfolio
### Showcasing the basic manipulation and learnings onto the responsive website

I am a teenager whose boredom is out of this world before when I started in the world of front-end, or to put it simply, coding. But when I do find my passion in the tech field. I just, learn and learn, nonstop from here on end. Watching video by video on youtube with applying what learned. Taking up every free certifications online to test me.
