## Introduction

Welcome to my portfolio documentation. This repository contains the source code for my static website. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with GSAP for animations. It is deployed on Netlify for easy access and sharing.

## Installation

To get started with the project locally, follow the steps below:

No additional dependencies are required to run this static website locally. Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
